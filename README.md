# Algorithms

> Algorithms is a step by step procedure for solving a computational problems.

## Algorithm vs Program

- Algorithm
	- Design phase
	- Domain knowledge
		- The one who having a knowledge about the domain for which the application is being developed need to design and construct algorithms.
	- writing in any languages
	- It's not dependent on hardware, operating system or what's machine you are going to use.
	- Analyze (time complexity, space complexity, and etc.)
- Program
	- Implementaion phase
	- Programmer do this job
	- writing in programming language
	- It's dependent on hardware and operating system.
	- Testing

## Priori Analysis & Posterior Testing

- Priori Analysis
	- Algorithm
	- Independent of language
	- Hardware Independent
	- Time * Space function
- Posterior Testing
	- Program
	- Language dependent
	- Hardware dependent
	- Watch time * Bytes

## Characteristics of Algorithm

1. Input
	- 0 or more 'i/p'.
2. Output
	- at least 1 'o/p'.
3. Definiteness
	- every steps are doing here is known step and so nothingn magical.
4. Finiteness
	- must have finite set of statements.
5. Effectiveness
	- don't do anything unnecessary.

## How to write an algorithm

You can write in any syntax with understandable steps for example:
- write a step inside block of code (`{}`) or define the word 'Begin' and 'End' at the starting and ending of steps respectively.
- assign a variable by `name = value` or `name <- value`.

## How to analyze on algorithm

1. Time -> How much time dost it use to perform a task?
2. Space -> How much memory does it use?
3. Network -> How much networks does it consume?
4. Power -> How much powers does it consume?
5. CPU Registers -> How much cpu registers does it consume?

## Frequency Count Method
